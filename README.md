Write a Python function called "calculator" that asks user to input a numerator and a denominator, divides the numerator by the denominator, and displays the answer. This then repeats in a loop.
If it encounters an error because of non-numerical input, it raises an exception and prints “Please enter a number”.
If it encounters an error because of the zero denominator, it raises another exception and prints “Can’t divide by zero.”
For all other errors, it raises an exception and prints “Unknown error.”
